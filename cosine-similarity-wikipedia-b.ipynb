      "these people are simply Winterson's puppets, jerked around by the\n",

      "of surrender, dutifully supplying visual equivalents for Winterson's\n",
      "sterile symmetries but despairing of any greater vivacity\", and is\n",
      "particularly critical of Winterson's screenplay, noting that:\n",
      "\"everything unrolls at the same stately pace, a religious procession\n",
      "bearing the reliquaries of Winterson's prose. It's as though the author\n",

      "sporadically magical romantic comedy embracing three barely compatible\n",
      "narrative strands, not one of which ever gets full flight\n",
